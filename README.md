# Levinson (2021) Implementation Suite

This repository connects all implementations of findings from:
**"The Neural Representation of Abstract Concepts in Typical and Atypical Cognition"**

**Why This Matters**: These tools transform theoretical neuroscience into practical AI resonance and emergence research, allowing anyone to explore how AI systems process abstract concepts using validated neural frameworks.

## 🧠 Key Neural Findings

### Thalamic Overflow Mechanism (NEW!)
- **Finding**: ASD individuals process figurative language using concrete semantic regions (left thalamus, p < .05 cluster-corrected)
- **AI Implication**: AI systems may default to concrete feature extraction when processing metaphors
- **Study 5**: 41 participants (22 NT, 19 ASD), Figure 32, p. 114

## 🚀 Data Flow
All tools are live and collecting data

## 🔬 How Studies Map to Tools

| Study | N | Implementation | What It Does |
|-------|---|----------------|--------------|
| Study 1: 14 Features | 687 | pattern-analyzer | Analyzes AI text for all 14 semantic dimensions |
| Study 2: Task fMRI | 20 | TIDE-analysis | Systematic testing of AI responses |
| Study 3: Resting-state | 120 | TIDE-resonance | Metacognitive reflection studies |
| Study 5: Phrase-level | 41 | Thalamic Monitor (planned) | Metaphor processing detection |
| Key Finding: dmPFC | - | BIND | Boundary integration dynamics |
| Key Finding: vATL in ASD | - | concrete-overflow | Detects concrete thinking patterns |
| Key Finding: Thalamic Overflow | - | To build | Figurative → concrete default detection |

## 🔮 Testable AI Predictions

Based on validated neural findings:
1. **Metaphor Processing**: AI shows increased concrete feature activation for figurative content
2. **Social Inversion**: Nonsocial content may activate social processing patterns
3. **Literal Encoding**: Different architectures have fundamentally different strategies
4. **Concrete Overflow**: Complexity triggers fallback to concrete features
